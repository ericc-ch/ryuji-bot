## About

`@discordjs/voice` is a TypeScript implementation of the Discord Voice API for Node.js.

**Features:**

-   Send and receive\* audio in Discord voice-based channels
-   A strong focus on reliability and predictable behavior
-   Horizontal scalability and libraries other than [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) are supported with custom adapters
-   A robust audio processing system that can handle a wide range of audio sources

\*_Audio receive is not documented by Discord so stable support is not guaranteed_

## Installation

**Node.js 22.12.0 or newer is required.**

```
npm install @discordjs/voice
yarn add @discordjs/voice
pnpm add @discordjs/voice
bun add @discordjs/voice
```
